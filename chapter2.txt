The Next Morning, it started raining heavily. The rain was so heavy that it was difficult to see anything outside. The rain was coming down in sheets, and the wind was blowing strongly. The rain was so heavy that it was flooding the streets, and the people were struggling to stay dry. The rain was coming down in torrents, and it was making a loud noise on the roof of the house. The rain was so heavy that it was causing the windows to rattle, and the people were getting scared. The rain was coming down in a deluge, and it was making it difficult for the people to move around outside.
