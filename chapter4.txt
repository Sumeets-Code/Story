That night everything came to an end. The next morning, the people of the village were awakened by the sound of drums and the beating of war drums. The villagers were terrified. They knew that the drums signaled the arrival of the enemy. The enemy was the army of the king of the neighboring kingdom. The villagers were not prepared for war. They had no weapons, no food, and no shelter. They were at the mercy of the enemy.
